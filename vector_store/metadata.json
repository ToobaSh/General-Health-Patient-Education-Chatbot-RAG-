Asthma can be controlled well \nin most people most of the time, although some people may have more persistent problems. \nOccasionally, asthma symptoms can get gradually or suddenly worse. This is known as an \n‘asthma attack’, although doctors sometimes use the term ‘exacerbation’. Severe attacks may \nneed hospital treatment and can be life threatening, although this is unusual.\nCauses\nAsthma is caused by inflammation of the small tubes, called bronchi, which carry air in and \nout of the lungs.
